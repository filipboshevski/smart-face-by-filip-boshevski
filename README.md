## Smart Face By Filip Boshevski

Smart Face is a face recognition software web application built in React along with a Node.js server. It uses Clarifai's Face Recognition API to spot a face on an image and highlight it with a square shape. It has a fully functional sign-in / register feature and even has a counter for your image entries.
